# Used Car Pricing System

This project, Sayarice, will be a data-driven car pricing system for the Jordanian second-hand market. It aims to solve the problem of inaccurate pricing by individual sellers on online platforms who lack market insights, leading to potential profit loss or prolonged selling times. The proposed solution involves using Machine Learning (ML) models trained on historical data from the Jordanian used car market to predict optimal prices.

The project will follow the CRISP-DM methodology, involving stages like data collection (web scraping), data understanding and preparation, modeling (regression algorithms), evaluation, and deployment as a user-friendly website. This website will allow users to input car details and receive price recommendations, along with data-driven insights.

Sayarice will primarily benefit individual car owners, but also used car buyers and online car listing platforms. The goal is to bring transparency and efficiency to the Jordanian second-hand car market.

##  Overview

This project encompasses the entire pipeline from data collection to deployment:

- **Web Scraping**: Collects car listings from OpenSooq.
- **Data Preprocessing & EDA**: Cleans and analyzes the data.
- **Modeling**: Builds machine learning models to predict car prices.
- **Deployment**: Provides a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

## Features

### Web Scraping

- Scrapes used car listings from [OpenSooq](https://jo.opensooq.com).
- Extracts attributes such as price, description score, and other details.
- Saves the scraped data to a CSV file.

### Data Preprocessing & EDA

- Cleans missing values and standardizes data formats.
- Handles outliers and irrelevant features.
- Separates data into electric and non-electric cars.
- Prepares the dataset for machine learning.

### Modeling

- Implements machine learning models for price prediction.
- Evaluates model performance and fine-tunes parameters.

### Deployment

- Develops a Streamlit web application for user-friendly interaction.
- Allows users to input car details and receive price predictions.

   cd Used-Cars-pricing-
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Run the web scraping script:**

   ```bash
   python Web\ Scraping/web_scraping_opensooq.py
   ```

2. **Process the data:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   - Open `Data Preprocessing & EDA/Data Preprocessing.ipynb` and run the cells.

3. **Train the model:**

   - Open `Modeling/modeling_pipeline.ipynb` and execute the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

4. **Launch the Streamlit app:**
