## Overview

The project focuses on extracting and processing car listing data from OpenSooq, a popular online marketplace. The collected data will be used to build an AI-powered pricing model.

## Features

### Web Scraping

- Extracts car listings from OpenSooq.
- Captures details such as price, description, and specifications.
- Saves the scraped data in a CSV file for further processing.

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleans and standardizes extracted data.
- Handles missing values and inconsistencies.
- Prepares the dataset for further analysis and modeling.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Scraper

```sh
python web_scraping_opensooq.py
```

### Running Data Preprocessing

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `Data Preprocessing.ipynb` and run the notebook cells.
